# 0023-TreasuryAllocation

- Status: Proposed
- Authors: Optim Labs

## Context

In order to prepare ourselves for the OUSD launch, we must seed the liquidity for it. We must have flexibility in the acquisition and deployment of USD-pegged stablecoins that will be used as seed reserve assets. Due to the rapidly changing market environment and stablecoin landscape on Cardano we must remain nimble in our strategy and deployment timelines. In light of 0023 passing but not being executed within the 7day window, it is necessary to consider a new proposal regarding OUSD preparation and the necessary Liquidity Adjustments and Treasury Adjustments.

## Proposal

### Liquidity Adjustments

Withdraw up to 1M from the 1.1M (OADA + ADA) liquidity from the OADA/ADA stableswap. The ADA portion may be converted to USD-pegged stablecoins at the Council's discretion, with the OADA portion reserved for the future OADA/OUSD pool.

Withdraw the liquidity from the O/ADA pool on Splash with flexibility to convert the ADA portion to the choice of stablecoins WanUSDC, USDM, or USDA, USDb for redeployment into O/USD-stablecoin pool. Provide liquidity back “redeployment” to new pool within 8 months or convert back to ADA and reseed original pool.

Withdraw the liquidity from the O/OADA pool on Splash with flexibility to convert up to 500k OADA to stablecoins WanUSDC, USDM, or USDA, USDb for redeployment into O/USD-stablecoin pool. Provide liquidity back / “redeployment” to the new pool within 8 months or convert back to ADA and reseed the original pool.

Withdraw the liquidity from the OADA/ADA pool on Wingriders with discretion to convert any portion to stablecoins WanUSDC, USDM, or USDA, USDb. All converted stablecoins will be held in the ODAO Treasury.

The intention is to, after the launch of OUSD, use the chosen stablecoins (WanUSDC, USDM, or USDA, USDb) as reserve assets and convert this liquidity into OUSD.

Liquidity Adjustments, General Asset Allocations, and DEX Allocation remain under control of ODAO Council. The Council has discretion but must abide by the following:

- Timing of conversions to USD-pegged stablecoins within a 8-month window
- Reseeding of liquidity to new Cardano pools within a 8-month window
- Reseeding a portion of ADA/OADA to old CardanoDEX pools within a 8-month window
- Conversion amount ranges from 0% up to the maximum amounts specified above
- Acceptable USD-pegged stablecoins for conversion and holding are defined as USDC, USDT, Dai, USDe, and FRAX
- Acceptable USD-pegged stablecoins for reseeding of liquidity on Cardano that eventually reserve assets for OUSD are defined as WanUSDC, USDM, or USDA, USDb
- After conversions to USD-pegged stablecoins but before reseeding of liquidity USD-pegged stablecoins can be held and invested on Ethereum, Base, or Arbitrum
- Acceptable holding investments are deposits into AAVE, sDai, sUSDe, sFRAX with no single investment comprising more than 25% of stablecoin holdings

### Treasury Adjustments

Authority to convert up to 675k ADA from Treasury and approximately 100k worth of sOADA from OADA fees into USD-pegged stablecoins, with amount and timing at Council's discretion within a 3-month window.

The stablecoins acquired through these adjustments will serve as potential reserve assets for OUSD. The specific composition of OUSD reserve assets (including but not limited to wanUSDC, USDA, USDM, and other USD-pegged stablecoins) will be subject to a separate DAO vote prior to OUSD launch.

Using USD-pegged stablecoins to serve as reserve assets on Cardano must occur within a 8-month window. Before that, USD-pegged stablecoins for conversion, holding, and investment fall under the Council Discretion rules outlined in the section above.

The Council will execute conversions at optimal market rates based on their judgment of market conditions within the specified timeframe of 3 months as specified in the Council Discretion rules outlined in the section above.

### Termination of Adjustment Window

If the ODAO and Council mutually agree that objectives have been met regarding Liquidity and Treasury Adjustments before the end of the 8 month window a simple ODAO proposal is to be proposed and voted on to terminate the window and define the new operating parameters.
